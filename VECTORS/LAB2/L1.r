Take the element-wise sum of the variables A_vector and B_vector and it assign to total_vector. The result should be a vector.
Inspect the result by printing total_vector to the console.
Do the same thing, but this time subtract B_vector from A_vector and assign the result to diff_vector.
Finally, print diff_vector to the console as well.
--------------------

# A_vector and B_vector have already been defined for you
A_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
B_vector <- c(4, 5, 6)

# Take the sum of A_vector and B_vector: total_vector
  total_vector <- A_vector + B_vector
  
# Print total_vector
total_vector

# Calculate the difference between A_vector and B_vector: diff_vector
diff_vector <- A_vector - B_vector

# Print diff_vector
diff_vector
