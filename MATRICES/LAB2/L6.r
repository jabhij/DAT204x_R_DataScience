Instructions --

Combine the matrices view_count_1 and view_count_2 in a new matrix, view_count_all, using cbind().
From view_count_all, subset the view counts for the three loudest debaters (Rachel, Walter and Dave). You can use subsetting by indices, 
names or a logical vector here. Store the result in the matrix view_count_loud.
Use the function colSums() to calculate the total number of times the loud debaters have seen any of the Star Wars movies. Store the 
result in a vector in total_views_loud.
