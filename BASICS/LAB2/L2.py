Adjust the code so that R knows you have 6 oranges and thus a fruit basket with 11 pieces of fruit.

# Assign a value to the variable called my_apples
my_apples <- 5 

# Print out the value of my_apples
my_apples       

# Assign a value to the variable my_oranges and print it out
my_oranges <- "six" 
my_oranges <- 6

# New variable that contains the total amount of fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges 
my_fruit
