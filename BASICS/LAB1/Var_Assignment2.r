Using <-, assign the value 5 to my_apples below the first comment.
Type my_apples below the second comment. This will print out the value of my_apples.
Click 'Submit Answer', and look at the console: you see that the number 5 is printed. So R now links the variable my_apples to the value 5


# Assign the value 5 to the variable called my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Print out the value of the variable my_apples
my_apples
